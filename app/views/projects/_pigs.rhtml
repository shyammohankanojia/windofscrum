  <i>Scrum Master:</i> Scrum is facilitated by a ScrumMaster, whose primary job is to remove impediments to the ability of the team to deliver the sprint goal.
  The ScrumMaster is not the leader of the team (as the team is self-organizing) but acts as a buffer between the team and any distracting influences.
  The ScrumMaster ensures that the Scrum process is used as intended. The ScrumMaster is the enforcer of rules.
  A key part of the ScrumMaster's role is to protect the team and keep them focused on the tasks in hand.
