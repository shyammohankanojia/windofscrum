******************
* WINDS OF SCRUM *
******************


This is a Winds of Scrum ALPHA release.
Although this application is still under development it is already usable as a normal Rails application.

INSTALLATION AND CONFIGURATION
==============================

During this installation reference the environment variable $WINDSOFSCRUM_HOME refers to the directory where Winds of Scrum is. For example: /home/oliver/prog/ruby/projects/windsofscrum

Installing Dependencies
-----------------------
The following list of gems is required:
* authlogic
	sudo gem install authlogic

* mysql (if using mysql DBMS)
  # On Ubuntu:
	sudo apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev ;(possibly)
	sudo gem install mysql
  # On MacOS X:
	gem install mysql -- --include=/usr/local/lib
  # On Windows:
	gem install mysql
	  Choose the win32 build.
	  Install MySQL and put its /bin directory on your path.

* postgres (if using postgresql DBMS)
	sudo gem install postgres

Remember that drivers like postgres and mysql require to have ruby development libraries installed:
sudo apt-get install ruby1.8-dev

Configuring Database
--------------------
Assuming the correct gems have been installed to connect to your DBMS, $WINDSOFSCRUM_HOME/config/database.yml will probably need to be configured according to your database configuration.
To do so, use the database.yml.template. For example:
    WINDSOFSCRUM_HOME> cp config/database.yml.template config/database.yml

On the database configuration there's a section for each execution environment that must be configured.
* adapter: is the driver to use for connecting to the database, for example the mysql or postgresql.
* encodig: Forces the encoding of the connection to be made in UTF-8.
* database: the database name on the DBMS.
* username: the username to use for connecting to the db.
* password: the passwor of 'username'.
* host: don't connect through socket (for those using jruby).

For production only the production section must be parameterized.
By default this project is configured to run on a mysql DBMS.
It uses a 'windsofscrum' schema for development and production as this environments doesn't use to be executed on the same machine.

- Useful configuration sentences for PostgreSQL:
CREATE DATABASE windsofscrum WITH ENCODING='UTF8';
CREATE USER pig WITH PASSWORD '4F0s8wj';
-- ALTER Role pig CREATEDB;
-- GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE windsofscrum TO pig;

- Configuration for MySql:
CREATE DATABASE windsofscrum CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci;
CREATE USER 'pig' IDENTIFIED BY '4F0s8wj';
CREATE USER 'pig'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '4F0s8wj';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON windsofscrum.* TO pig@localhost;

- Creating tables
	Simply from your $WINDSOFSCRUM_HOME execute the command:

$ rake db:migrate


USERS
=====
    By default an administrator user is added to the DB.
login:  admin
pwd:    songoku

    Remember to update administrator's password just after deploying the app.
    It is not that this "administrator" user will have more permissions or privileges over new users but it's called like this as a convention.
